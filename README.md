# KDTree

[![Build Status](https://ci.younata.com/api/v1/pipelines/Other/jobs/KDTree_Tests/badge)](https://ci.younata.com/teams/main/pipelines/Other/jobs/KDTree_Tests)

An implementation of [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) in swift, where k == 3 (3 dimensional k-d tree).

The implementation is largely based off of [This lecture from CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/kdtrees.pdf).

This is not a fully generic implementation.
